          p It's Wintertime which can only mean one thing - it's GraphGist time!

          p Like last year we want to sweeten your long winter evenings with a Winter Challenge to come up with the most helpful and ingenious graph models and example queries.

          p This year we're going to focus on some of the uses cases that graph databases are best suited to handle:
