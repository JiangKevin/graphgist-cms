          p Documenting your graph domain model has never been easier. A GraphGist is just a simple AsciiDoc text file, and can be hosted in a GitHub Gist or any other place with an accessible URL. It will be rendered as an interactive page in your browser.

          p You can explore those pages, read and understand them and try out the provided use-case queries on a live graph. We want to encourage you to model a domain that you know or like in a graph model and describe it interactively in a GraphGist.

        p GraphGist Challenges

      .panel-body
        p The best way gathering great graph models is to ask your community. That's why we already ran two challenges to find interesting ideas for GraphGists with tremendous results.

        p The first challenge in September 2013 had 17 submissions and 3 winners.

        p Our GraphGist Winter Challenge (Dec 2013-Jan 2014) asked for contributions in 10 categories. We got an impressive 65 submissions. Here are the winners per category

        p But we don't stop here. There will be more challenges. And you can even win now.

        p Every original Graph Model that is submitted via this form will get a personalized Neo4j T-Shirt from us.
