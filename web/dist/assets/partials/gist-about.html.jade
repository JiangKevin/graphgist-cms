      p With Neo4j GraphGists you can describe and model your domain in a simple text file and render it as a rich, interactive page in any browser. Perfect to document a specific domain, use-case, question or graph problem.

      p Documenting your graph domain model has never been easier. A GraphGist is just a simple AsciiDoc text file, and can be hosted in a GitHub Gist or any other place with an accessible URL. It will be rendered as an interactive page in your browser.

      p You can explore those pages, read and understand them and try out the provided use-case queries on a live graph. We want to encourage you to model a domain that 
       em you know or like 
        in a graph model and describe it interactively in a GraphGist.

      p To learn about interesting existing models created by other Neo4j users browse the 
        a(href="/") impressive collection.

    h1 GraphGist Challenges

    <p>The best way gathering great graph models is to ask your community.             That's why we already ran two challenges to find interesting ideas for GraphGists with tremendous results.</p>            
    <p>The first challenge in September 2013 had <a href="https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/graphgist/wiki#wiki-graphgist-september-challenge-submissions">17 submissions</a> and <a href="http://blog.neo4j.org/2013/10/the-first-graphgist-challenge-completed.html">3 winners</a>.</p>
    
    <p>Our GraphGist Winter Challenge (Dec 2013-Jan 2014) asked for contributions in 10 categories. We got an impressive <a href="https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/graphgist/wiki#wiki-graphgist-winter-challenge-submissions---categories">65 submissions</a>. Here are the <a href="http://blog.neo4j.org/2014/02/graph-gist-winter-challenge-winners.html">winners per category</a></p>
